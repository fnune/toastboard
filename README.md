# Toastboard

The toastboard is a beginner embedded development project with the following objectives:

- Learning how to integrate the [Memfault real-time SDK](https://docs.memfault.com/).
- Using the [ESP8266 RTOS SDK](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp8266-rtos-sdk) to learn how to operate my ESP8266 board using an RTOS.
